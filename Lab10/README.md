# lab 10. React.js: Redux: Cart page (shopping cart)

# Description:
You are on your way to finishing this insane project… Create the first of three cart pages - Shopping cart page.
Also, here you meet one of the most popular React library - Redux.

## Variants -  (products that you are ‘selling’) the same as for previous works. (see the description to 3rd work)

## Requirements: 
●	All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
●	Functionality:
○	Item page: “Add to cart” action should be implemented using Redux flow: when you add an item to cart, it should be added to your redux store. On Cart page you take all of the items from the store
○	Cart page: “add/remove” actions should be implemented through redux actions & reducers as well.
●	 Code style: 
○	Redux: All Redux parts (actions / reducers / store) should be kept in separate and specific files (actions.js / reducers.js / store.js etc.)
○	Use useSelector hook for getting the data from redux store (instead of connect() function)

○	Use useDispatch hook for dispatching your actions (instead of connect() function)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
