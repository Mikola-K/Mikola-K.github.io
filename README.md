# Lab 2 - Partly responsive landing page
## <b>Description:</b> Improve a landing page following the given design (same as previous) by adding full responsiveness and some animation.

## <b>Requirements:</b>

- The website should be partly responsive: required for <b>320px</b> (iPhone 5s) and <b>2560px</b> (4K screens).
- The header should collapse to a hamburger on small screens.
- The website must contain animations (at least 3). Can be made in any possible way, preferably with css properties
